// The following options are passed to mongoose.connect() in the above code:
// useNewUrlParser: This option tells Mongoose to use the new MongoDB Node.js driver's new URL string
// parser instead of the deprecated one. The MongoDB connection string can be a bit complex with the
// inclusion of user credentials, the server (or cluster of servers), and optionally a variety of
// configuration options. The new parser is more capable and resilient to unusual connection strings
// and is generally more maintainable. As of Mongoose 5.7.0, the useNewUrlParser option is true by default.

// useUnifiedTopology: This is a more recent option. The MongoDB Node.js driver reworked its internal
// structure, specifically the management of connections to MongoDB servers, in order to support new
// MongoDB features more easily. The useUnifiedTopology option tells Mongoose to use the new connection
// management engine. It's generally a good idea to enable this, as the old connection management engine
// has been deprecated and will be removed in future versions. As of Mongoose 5.7.0, the useUnifiedTopology
// option is also true by default.
